Orders Dataset: Order lifecycle timestamps, status, and delivery details.
Order Items Dataset: Product, seller, price, freight value, and shipping deadlines.
Order Payments Dataset: Payment method, value, and installment details.
Order Reviews Dataset: Review scores, comments, and timestamps.
Products Dataset: Product category, dimensions, and metadata.
